# Why Use Recursion?

## What is recursion?

a **process** (a function) that **calls itself**

## Why do I need to know this?

It is everywhere.

- JSON.parse or JSON.stringify are recursive functions
- document.getElementById and DOM traversal algorithms
- Object traversal
- We will see it with more complex data structures
- It's sometimes cleaner alternative to iteration
