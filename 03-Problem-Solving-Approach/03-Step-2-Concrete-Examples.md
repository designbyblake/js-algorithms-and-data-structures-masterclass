## Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string.

```javascript
charCount("aaaa"); // {a:4}
charCount("hello"); // {h:1, e:1, l:2, o:1}
charCount("my phone number is 8675309");
charCount("Hello hi");
```

Start asking questions to help determine the full requirements. This will help to not overthink solutions and also show how you think through problems.

- Do we only want to return characters that exist or all characters with some as 0?
- Do we count spaces?
- Does capitalization count as a different character?
- What do we return if the input is invalid?
