# Step 1: Understand the Problem

## Problem Solving

- Understand the problem
- Explore concrete examples
- Break it down
- Solve and/or simplify
- Look back and refactor

Many of the strategies being taught are adapted from George Polya, whos book "How To Solve It" is a great resource (Math Based).

## Understand the problem

1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
1. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
1. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
1. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? Is there enough information to solve the problem?
1. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
