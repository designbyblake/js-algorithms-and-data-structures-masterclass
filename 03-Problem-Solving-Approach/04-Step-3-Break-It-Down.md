# Step 3: Break It Down

## Explicitly write ou the steps you need to take

It doesn't need to be line by or line or in large detail. High level overview of what you need to do.

It forces you to think about the code you'll write before you write it, and helps catch misunderstandings.

## Example

It has been determined that only alpha numeric characters need to be counted

```javascript
function charCount(str) {
  // create character object to hold count that will be returned at the end
  // Remove non-alpha numerica characers from string
  // loop through string characters
  // if key for character exists in object add 1 to current value
  // if key does not exist, create it and set value to 1
  // return character object
}
```
