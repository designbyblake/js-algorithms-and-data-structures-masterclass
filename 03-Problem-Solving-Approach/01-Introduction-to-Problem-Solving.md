# Introduction to Problem Solving

Algorithms and Problem Solving Patterns

## Objectives

- Define what an algorithm is
- Devise a plan to solve algorithms
- Compare and contrast problme solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conquer

## What is an Algorithm?

A **process** or **set of steps** to accomplish a certain task.

## Why do I need to know this?

Almost everything in programming involves some kind of algorithm! It's the foundation for being a succesful problem solving and developer. And interviews, so many interview questions.

## How do you improve?

1. **Devise** a plan for solving problems
1. **Master** common problem solving patterns

## Problem Solving

- Understand the Problem
- Explore Concrete Examples
- Break It Down
- Solve/Simplify
- Look Back and Refactor
