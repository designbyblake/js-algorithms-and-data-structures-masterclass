## Recap

- To analyze the performance of an algorithm, we use Big O Notation
- Big O Notation can give us a high level understanding of the time or space complexity of an algorithm
- Big O Notation doesn't care about precision, only about general trends (Linear? quadratic? constant?)
- The time of space complexity (as measured by Big O) depends only on the algorithm, not the hardware used to run the algorithm
- Big O Notation is everywhere, so get lots of practice!
